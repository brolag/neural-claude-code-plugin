## The Problem

Every Claude Code session starts from zero. You explain your project structure, conventions, and preferences... again and again.

## The Solution

Neural Claude Code remembers. It learns patterns, accumulates knowledge, and gets smarter over time.

```
Traditional: Execute -> Forget -> Repeat forever
Neural:      Execute -> Learn  -> Improve always
```

---

## Quick Start

**One command to install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brolag/neural-claude-code-plugin/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:
- Clone the repository
- Configure your shell
- Register all commands
- Set up hooks
- Offer to install recommended skills

**Then run the guided tour:**

```bash
/onboard
```

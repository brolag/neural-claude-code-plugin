  <strong>Claude Code that learns and improves from every interaction.</strong>
</p>

---

## The Problem

Every Claude Code session starts from zero. You explain your project structure, conventions, and preferences... again and again.

## The Solution

Neural Claude Code remembers. It learns patterns, accumulates knowledge, and gets smarter over time.

```
Traditional: Execute → Forget → Repeat forever
Neural:      Execute → Learn  → Improve always
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/brolag/neural-claude-code-plugin ~/Sites/neural-claude-code-plugin

# 2. Setup
cd ~/Sites/neural-claude-code-plugin && ./scripts/setup-hooks.sh

# 3. Add to shell
echo 'export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$HOME/Sites/neural-claude-code-plugin"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

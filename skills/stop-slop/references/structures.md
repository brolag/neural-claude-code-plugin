# Structures to Avoid

## Binary Contrasts

These create false drama. State the point directly.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Not because X. Because Y." | Telegraphed reversal |
| "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is." | Formulaic reframe |
| "The answer isn't X. It's Y." | Predictable pivot |
| "It feels like X. It's actually Y." | Setup/reveal cliche |
| "The question isn't X. It's Y." | Rhetorical misdirection |
| "It's not about X. It's about Y." | False dichotomy |

**Fix:** State Y directly. "The problem is Y." "Y matters here."

## Dramatic Fragmentation

Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." | Performative simplicity |
| "X. And Y. And Z." | Staccato drama |
| "This unlocks something. [Word]." | Artificial revelation |
| "One word: [word]." | Forced emphasis |
| "[Statement]. Full stop." | Redundant finality |

**Fix:** Complete sentences. Trust content over presentation.

## Rhetorical Setups

These announce insight rather than deliver it.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "What if [reframe]?" | Socratic posturing |
| "Here's what I mean:" | Redundant preview |
| "Think about it:" | Condescending prompt |
| "And that's okay." | Unnecessary permission |
| "Let me explain." | Just explain |
| "Here's the secret:" | False exclusivity |
| "The [adjective] part?" | Building false suspense |

**Fix:** Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.

## Formulaic Constructions

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "By the time X, I was Y." | Narrative template |
| "X that isn't Y" | Indirect. Say "X is broken" |
| "The [noun] of [noun]" | Abstraction stacking |
| "[Year] called. It wants X back." | Dated reference |

## Rhythm Patterns

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Three-item lists | Use two items or one |
| Questions answered immediately | Let questions breathe or cut them |
| Paragraphs starting with "So" | Start with content |
| Sentences starting with "Look," | Remove |
| Every paragraph ends punchily | Vary endings |
| Em-dashes before reveals | Use periods or commas |
| All short sentences | Mix lengths |
| All long sentences | Break some up |

## List Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Rule of three everywhere | Predictable, overused |
| Numbered lists for everything | Not everything needs structure |
| Bullet points as padding | Cut if not adding value |

**Fix:** Two items often land harder than three. Sometimes one is enough.

## Ending Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Punchy one-liner ending | Every AI does this |
| Call to action ending | Feels salesy |
| Question ending | Can feel manipulative |
| "And that's [summary]" | Redundant |

**Fix:** Vary your endings. Sometimes just stop.

### Major Cleanup Release - Anti-Bloat Consolidation

Complete system audit and cleanup following the 5 Critical Questions framework:
1. **Frequency**: Is this done 5+ times per week?
2. **Complexity**: Does it take 3+ steps manually?
3. **Consistency**: Is the process the same each time?
4. **Value**: Does automating save significant time/effort?
5. **Existing**: Is there already something that does this?

### Archived (Moved to `*/archived/`)

## [3.1.0] - 2026-01-12

### Claude Code v2.1.x Integration - Hidden Patterns Release

Major feature release implementing 10 breakthrough patterns discovered by synthesizing Claude Code v2.1.x features with Neural Claude Code architecture.

### Added

#### Research Swarm (`/research-swarm`)
Parallel forked research agents using `context: fork` for true cognitive isolation.
- Launch 3-5 parallel research agents simultaneously
- Each agent explores independently without context contamination
- Synthesize findings into comprehensive report
- Best for: broad research, competitive analysis, multi-angle exploration

#### Parallel Multi-AI Verification Mesh (`/pv-mesh`)
Combines AlphaGo-style parallel verification with true AI diversity.
- Run Claude, Codex, and Gemini in parallel forks (single message, 3 Task calls)
- Each AI uses its unique strengths (Claude: accuracy, Codex: terminal, Gemini: algorithms)
- 3x faster than sequential `/ai-collab` (15-20s vs 45-60s)
- Best for: architecture decisions, complex debugging, security reviews

#### Teleport Memory Bridge (`/teleport-sync`)
Synchronize memory state between local CLI and cloud (claude.ai) sessions.
- `export` - Pack memory into portable JSON blob for clipboard
- `import` - Unpack memory blob back to local files
- `status` - Check sync state
- Best for: hybrid execution (local work → cloud web access → return with results)

#### Expertise Watcher Script (`scripts/expertise-watcher.sh`)
Self-improving agent mesh infrastructure using fswatch.
- Watches `.claude/expertise/*.yaml` for changes
- Broadcasts updates to all active agents via systemMessage injection
- Queues changes for next session consumption
- Usage: `./expertise-watcher.sh start|stop|status|consume`

#### Expertise Streamer Script (`scripts/expertise-streamer.sh`)
Real-time expertise streaming during active sessions.
- Injects updates IMMEDIATELY into running session (vs. queuing)
- Manual injection support: `./expertise-streamer.sh inject "message"`
- Usage: `./expertise-streamer.sh start|stop|status|inject|consume`

#### Deep Research Hook (`scripts/deep-research-hook.sh`)
10-minute timeout research hook for deep web scraping.
- Runs AFTER neural loop iterations
- Full article scraping (not just snippets)
- Cross-references multiple sources
- Queue format: `TOPIC|URL1,URL2,URL3`
- Results output to `.claude/loop/research-results.md`

#### Wildcard Bash Permissions (`config/bash-permissions.yaml`)
Auto-approve safe command patterns for truly autonomous loops.
- Testing: pytest, npm test, vitest, jest
- Linting: eslint, prettier (check only)
- Git (read-only): status, diff, log, branch, show
- Claude scripts: `.claude/scripts/*.sh` (with exclusions for destructive commands)
- Context-specific: extra approvals during neural-loop, tdd modes
- Deny patterns: rm -rf, force push, sudo, DROP DATABASE, etc.

### Changed

#### Session Start Script Enhancements
- **Layered Background Loading**: Load expertise, memory, and inbox items in background for faster startup
- **Agent Mesh Integration**: Consumes broadcast queue from expertise-watcher
- **Clickable Memory Navigation**: OSC 8 hyperlinks for inbox items and facts (clickable in terminal)

### Technical Details

These patterns leverage Claude Code v2.1.x features:
- `context: fork` - Isolated sub-agent contexts
- 10-minute hook timeouts (600s) - Deep research capability
- Wildcard bash permissions - Autonomous loop enablement
- OSC 8 hyperlinks - Terminal file navigation
- Unified Ctrl+B backgrounding - Background task management
- Skill hot-reload from ~/.claude/skills

### Best Practices

**When to use each pattern:**

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| `/research-swarm` | Need broad coverage of a topic |
| `/pv-mesh` | Need fast multi-AI consensus |
| `/teleport-sync` | Moving between local and cloud Claude |
| Expertise Watcher | Setting up persistent learning |
| Deep Research Hook | Running extended research loops |
| Bash Permissions | Enabling autonomous loops |

### Neural Loop v2 - Major Upgrade

Neural Loop v2 incorporates learnings from three authoritative sources:
- **Ralph Wiggum** (Matt Pocock) - 11 tips for autonomous AI coding
- **Anthropic Engineering** - Effective harnesses for long-running agents
- **Vercel v0** - Multi-system pipeline architecture

### Added

#### Enhanced `/loop-start` with new options
- **`--sandbox`** - Run in Docker container for AFK safety
- **`--type <type>`** - Loop types: feature, coverage, lint, entropy
- **`--init`** - Auto-run /loop-init before starting

#### New Specialized Loop Commands
- **`/loop-init`** - Initialize features.json and progress.txt before loops
  - Breaks task into discrete features with passes: true/false tracking
  - Creates structured progress file for inter-iteration memory
  - Runs health checks before starting work

- **`/loop-coverage`** - Test coverage improvement loop
  - Targets specific coverage percentage
  - Prioritizes critical code paths
  - One test per iteration for quality

- **`/loop-lint`** - Linting cleanup loop
  - Fixes ONE error per iteration
  - Verifies fix before moving on
  - Auto-detects linter type

- **`/loop-entropy`** - Code smell cleanup loop
  - Fights software entropy
  - Focus areas: unused, dead, patterns
  - Leaves codebase better than found

#### Key Principles (from Ralph Wiggum)
1. **Agent picks the task** - Define end state, not steps
2. **Progress file for memory** - Cheaper than re-exploring codebase
3. **Promise-based exit** - `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` pattern
4. **Single feature per iteration** - Prevents context exhaustion
5. **Small steps** - Context rot makes large tasks worse
6. **Prioritize risky tasks** - Architecture first, polish last
7. **Fight entropy** - Poor code leads to poorer code

#### New Files
- `commands/loop-init.md` - Initialize loop artifacts
- `commands/loop-coverage.md` - Coverage-focused loop
- `commands/loop-lint.md` - Linting-focused loop
- `commands/loop-entropy.md` - Entropy cleanup loop
- JSON schema for features.json tracking

### Changed
- `/loop-start` now supports v2 state format with loop_type, sandbox, features_file
- Progress file location moved to `.claude/loop/progress.txt`

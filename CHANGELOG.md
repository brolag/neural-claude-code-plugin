## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-08

### Neural Loop v2 - Major Upgrade

Neural Loop v2 incorporates learnings from three authoritative sources:
- **Ralph Wiggum** (Matt Pocock) - 11 tips for autonomous AI coding
- **Anthropic Engineering** - Effective harnesses for long-running agents
- **Vercel v0** - Multi-system pipeline architecture

### Added

#### Enhanced `/loop-start` with new options
- **`--sandbox`** - Run in Docker container for AFK safety
- **`--type <type>`** - Loop types: feature, coverage, lint, entropy
- **`--init`** - Auto-run /loop-init before starting

#### New Specialized Loop Commands
- **`/loop-init`** - Initialize features.json and progress.txt before loops
  - Breaks task into discrete features with passes: true/false tracking
  - Creates structured progress file for inter-iteration memory
  - Runs health checks before starting work

- **`/loop-coverage`** - Test coverage improvement loop
  - Targets specific coverage percentage
  - Prioritizes critical code paths
  - One test per iteration for quality

- **`/loop-lint`** - Linting cleanup loop
  - Fixes ONE error per iteration
  - Verifies fix before moving on
  - Auto-detects linter type

- **`/loop-entropy`** - Code smell cleanup loop
  - Fights software entropy
  - Focus areas: unused, dead, patterns
  - Leaves codebase better than found

#### Key Principles (from Ralph Wiggum)
1. **Agent picks the task** - Define end state, not steps
2. **Progress file for memory** - Cheaper than re-exploring codebase
3. **Promise-based exit** - `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` pattern
4. **Single feature per iteration** - Prevents context exhaustion
5. **Small steps** - Context rot makes large tasks worse
6. **Prioritize risky tasks** - Architecture first, polish last
7. **Fight entropy** - Poor code leads to poorer code

#### New Files
- `commands/loop-init.md` - Initialize loop artifacts
- `commands/loop-coverage.md` - Coverage-focused loop
- `commands/loop-lint.md` - Linting-focused loop
- `commands/loop-entropy.md` - Entropy cleanup loop
- JSON schema for features.json tracking

### Changed
- `/loop-start` now supports v2 state format with loop_type, sandbox, features_file
- Progress file location moved to `.claude/loop/progress.txt`
- State file includes version field for compatibility

## [1.6.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added

#### Parallel Verification Skill
- **`/pv <problem>`** - AlphaGo-style parallel hypothesis exploration
  - **Diverge Phase**: Generate 3-5 distinct hypotheses for any problem
  - **Explore Phase**: Spawn multiple agents in parallel to investigate each path
  - **Verify Phase**: Cross-check results for contradictions, test edge cases
  - **Converge Phase**: Synthesize the strongest solution from all paths
  - Inspired by DeepMind's approach that beat the world Go champion

- **Multi-AI Enhancement**
  - Route different hypotheses to different models (Opus, Codex, Gemini)
  - True cognitive diversity, not just prompt variations
  - Configurable: `num_hypotheses`, `agent_type`, `timeout_per_agent`

- **Best Use Cases**
  - Complex debugging (multiple possible root causes)
  - Architecture decisions (trade-offs need multi-angle analysis)
  - Mathematical proofs (one error ruins everything)
  - Strategic planning (decision trees need exploration)

#### Smart Task Router
- **`/route <task>`** - Intelligent multi-AI cost optimization
  - Analyzes tasks and recommends optimal AI routing
  - Decision matrix based on task characteristics

- **Routing Tiers**
  - **Qwen (Local)**: Boilerplate, syntax, examples → 100% savings
  - **Gemini**: Algorithms, data transforms → 89% savings
  - **Codex**: DevOps, terminal, long sessions → 65% savings
  - **Opus**: Architecture, security, critical code → Premium accuracy

- **Plan-Execute Pattern** recommendation for complex tasks
  - Opus plans (5-10% tokens) → Gemini executes (70-80%) → Opus reviews (10-20%)
  - 60-70% cost savings on multi-step implementations

#### Skill Telemetry System
- **`scripts/log-skill-execution.sh`** - Track skill performance
  - Logs: skill name, trigger type (manual/auto), outcome, duration
  - Updates `skill-performance.json` with metrics
  - Tracks: total executions, completion rate, dismissal rate, auto-trigger rate

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Enables data-driven skill improvement via `/evolve`
  - Identifies underperforming or over-triggered skills

#### Documentation
- **`docs/ROUTING_PLAYBOOK.md`** - Quick reference for multi-AI routing
  - 60-second decision tree
  - Quick commands table
  - Daily routing habits guide
  - Monthly savings estimates

### Usage

```bash
# Parallel verification for complex problems
/pv Why is our API returning 500 errors intermittently?

# Smart routing for cost optimization
